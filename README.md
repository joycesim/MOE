# MOE (Magma Ocean Evolution)
A python library for modeling thermal evolution of magma oceans in terrestrial planets.

Accompanying manuscript: "Volatile and Trace Element Storage in a Crystallizing Martian Magma Ocean", S. J. Sim, S. Hier-Majumder and M. M. Hirschmann 2023

Start with Simulations.py and make sure to have a data folder when running it as this will be where all the model outputs get saved. 

If you do not want to run the simulations, there is a zip file, data.zip, that you can unzip and use that to generate the plots in the manuscript.

After all the data files are generated, run shmh23_plots.py script to generate all the plots for the manuscript.
